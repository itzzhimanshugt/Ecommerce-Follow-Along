# E-Commerce Application - Milestone 1

This is the first step in building an e-commerce app using the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

## 📋 About the Project
In this milestone, I learned:
- The structure of a MERN stack project.
- How to build basic REST APIs for tasks like user login, product management, and orders.
- The importance of authentication and database design.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
1. **MERN Stack**: A full-stack JavaScript-based framework.
2. **REST APIs**: Enable frontend and backend communication.
3. **Database Schema**: Defines how data is stored in MongoDB.
4. **Authentication**: Verifies users before accessing secure data.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Set up tools and a development environment.
- Create a basic server with Node.js and Express.
- Start connecting the backend and frontend.
